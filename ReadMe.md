# A Little Java, A Few Patterns
- The First Bit of Advice
When specifying a collection fo data, use abstract classes of datatypes and extended classes for variants.
- The Second Bit of Advice
When writing a function over a datatype, place a method in each of the varints that make up the datatype.
If a field of a variant belongs to the same datatype, the method may call the corresponding method of the field in computing the function.
- The Third Bit of Advice
When writing a function that returns values of a datatype, use new to create these values.
- The Fourth Bit of Advice
When writing several functions for the same self-referential datatype, use visitor protocols so that all methods for a function
can be found in a single class.
- The Sixth Bit of Advice
When the additional consumed values change for a self-referential use of a visitor, don't forget to create a new visitor.
- The Seventh Bit of Advice
When designing visitor protocols for many different types, create a unifying protocol using object.
- The Eighth Bit of Advice
When extending a class, use overriding to enrich its functionality.
- The Ninth Bit of Advice
If a datatype may have to extended, be forward looking and use a constructor-like(overridable) method so that visitors can be extend, too.
- The Tenth Bit of Advice
When modifications to objects are needed, use a class to insulate the operations that modify objects. Otherwise, beware of the consequences of your actions.
